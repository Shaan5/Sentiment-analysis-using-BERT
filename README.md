This project is completed under the guidance of Ari Anastassiou (Machine Learning Engineer at IoT.nxt)

# Introduction

BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is actually many things. Google search algorithm ingredient /tool/framework called Google BERT which aims to help Search better understand the nuance and context of words in Searches and better match those queries with helpful results.

 BERT is a natural language processing NLP framework that Google produced and then open-sourced so that the whole natural language processing research field could actually get better at natural language understanding overall.
 
 # Why BERT ?
 Now the real question comes, why we are using bert when there are numerous tools available out there ?
 
 The answer to this question lies in its benefits with various functionalities.
 1. BERT achieves 93.2% F1 score (a measure of accuracy), surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 91.6% and human-level score of 91.2%
 2. BERT also improves the state-of-the-art by 7.6% absolute on the very challenging GLUE benchmark, a set of 9 diverse Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
 3. It specifically deals with the problems like
      i. Ambiguity & Polysemy
      ii. Wordâ€™s Context
      iii. Homographs and homophones
      iv. Anaphora and cataphora resolution
      v. Multi-sentential resolution
      vi. Coreference resolution
      
      # About the project 
      
      For this project we are going to use SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset which contains 3,085 tweets, with 5 emotions namely anger, disgust, happiness, surprise and sadness.
      We are going to evaluate and predict the sentiment of the user on the basis of statementprovided by categorizing into 5 emotions.
      
      # Future Modification
      
      In the later stages, we are going to filter the sarcasm statement of the user to avoid biasing along with adding mediate emotions along with the prominent ones.
